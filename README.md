GSI-Protocol is an automated Specification-Driven Development (SDD) workflow system that transforms user requirements into production-ready code through a structured 4-phase process: Specification → Architecture → Implementation → Verification.

## Features

- **Multi-Platform Support**: Works with Claude Code, Codex (OpenAI), and GitHub Copilot
- **Language Agnostic**: Architecture design independent of programming language
- **Automated Workflow**: Execute complete development cycle with a single command
- **BDD Integration**: Built-in support for Gherkin specifications and integration tests
- **Project-Aware**: Automatically detects and adapts to your project's tech stack
- **Role-Based Phases**: PM → Architect → Engineer → QA workflow

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install using `uvx` (recommended):

```bash
uvx --from gsi-protocol-installer gsi-install
```

Or using `pipx`:

```bash
pipx run gsi-protocol-installer
```

The installer will guide you through:
1. Selecting AI platform(s) (Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot)
2. Choosing installation type (global or project-specific)
3. Installing workflow commands

### Basic Usage

#### Automatic Mode (Recommended)

Execute the complete 4-phase workflow automatically:

```bash
# For Claude Code / Codex
/sdd-auto <your requirement>

# For GitHub Copilot
@workspace /sdd-auto <your requirement>
```

Example:
```bash
/sdd-auto Add user authentication with email and password
```

#### Manual Mode

For more control over each phase:

1. **Generate Specification** (PM Phase)
   ```bash
   /sdd-spec <requirement>
   ```

2. **Design Architecture** (Architect Phase)
   ```bash
   /sdd-arch <feature_file_path>
   ```

3. **Implement Code** (Engineer Phase)
   ```bash
   /sdd-impl <feature_file_path>
   ```

4. **Verify Implementation** (QA Phase)
   ```bash
   /sdd-verify <feature_file_path>
   ```

5. **Generate Integration Tests** (Optional)
   ```bash
   /sdd-integration-test <feature_file_path>
   ```

## Workflow Overview

The GSI-Protocol follows a structured 4-phase process:

```
User Requirement
      ↓
[Phase 1: Specification (PM)]
   → features/{feature}.feature (Gherkin)
      ↓
[Phase 2: Architecture (Architect)]
   → docs/features/{feature}/architecture.md
      ↓
[Phase 3: Implementation (Engineer)]
   → Source code files
      ↓
[Phase 4: Verification (QA)]
   → docs/features/{feature}/conclusion.md
```

> **Learn the methodology**: Read our [GSI Theory & Methodology guide](./docs/gsi-theory.md) to understand how **Gherkin** (specification), **Structure** (architecture), and **Implement** (code) work together.

## Available Commands

| Command | Description | Phase |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `/sdd-auto` | Execute complete workflow automatically | All |
| `/sdd-spec` | Generate Gherkin specification from requirements | 1 |
| `/sdd-arch` | Design architecture from specification | 2 |
| `/sdd-impl` | Implement code based on architecture | 3 |
| `/sdd-verify` | Verify implementation against spec | 4 |
| `/sdd-integration-test` | Generate BDD integration tests | Optional |

## Output Structure

After running the workflow, your project will have:

```
project_root/
├── features/
│   └── {feature_name}.feature          # Gherkin specifications
├── docs/
│   └── features/
│       └── {feature_name}/
│           ├── architecture.md         # Architecture design
│           └── conclusion.md           # Verification report
└── {your_project_structure}/
    ├── {model_files}                   # Generated models
    └── {service_files}                 # Generated services
```

## Platform-Specific Usage

### Claude Code

Commands are available directly in Claude Code CLI:
```bash
/sdd-auto <requirement>
/sdd-spec <requirement>
```

### Codex (OpenAI)

Use prompts with argument placeholders:
```bash
/sdd-auto <requirement>
```

### GitHub Copilot

Prefix commands with `@workspace`:
```bash
@workspace /sdd-auto <requirement>
@workspace /sdd-spec <requirement>
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git
- One of the supported AI platforms:
  - Claude Code CLI
  - Codex (OpenAI)
  - GitHub Copilot
